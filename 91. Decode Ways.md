**Dynamic Programming**, **String**    [🧡](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways)    

#### Description

A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```

Given a **non-empty** string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "226"
