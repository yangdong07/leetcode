### 8. String to Integer (atoi)

**String**, **Math**    [🧡](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi)    

#### Description

Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

**Note:**
- Only the space character `' '` is considered as whitespace character.
- Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 − 1) or INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "42"
Output: 42
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
```

#### Analysis
这个没啥好说的。挑战是 要应对所有的输入情况

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases.


1. 去掉首部空白字符：有效字符： +-0123456789， 需满足正则表达式： `[+-]?\d+`
2. 去掉末尾的其他无效字符。
3. 如果首部遇到无效字符，则返回0。  如果转换的数字超过了有效范围，返回上下限。

按照顺序写代码就可以了。很简单。

#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s):
        """
        :type str: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(s) == 0:
            return 0

        INT_MAX = 2147483647
        INT_MIN = -2147483648

        i = 0
        while (s[i] == ' '):
            i += 1

        neg = False
        if s[i] == '+':
            i += 1
        elif s[i] == '-':
            i += 1
            neg = True

        num = 0
        n_digits = 0
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            d = ord(s[j]) - 48  # ord('0')
            if d < 0 or d > 9:
                break
            num = num * 10 + d
            n_digits += 1
            if n_digits > 10:  # avoid too long digits
                break

        if neg:
            num = -num
        if num > INT_MAX:
            return INT_MAX
        elif num < INT_MIN:
            return INT_MIN
        else:
            return num

print(Solution().myAtoi('123'))
print(Solution().myAtoi('  sdlfjklsd'))
print(Solution().myAtoi('  +12345'))
print(Solution().myAtoi(' - 1234'))
print(Solution().myAtoi('123'))
print(Solution().myAtoi('-'))

```
