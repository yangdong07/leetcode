### 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

**Two Pointers**, **Array**    [🧡](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii)    

#### Description

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that duplicates appeared at most _twice_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

#### Analysis

题目要求： 有序数组； 就地去重，但是允许有最多2个重复。返回去重后的数组长度

```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return len(nums)
    i = 1
    for j in range(2, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i] or nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

- 如果数组长度小于 3，最多有2个重复，是允许的，所以返回数组长度即可。
- 如果不是就地去重，可以更好理解 `i`的作用：

```python
def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return len(nums)
    ans = nums[:2]
    for j in range(2, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != ans[-1] or ans[-1] != ans[-2]:
            ans.append(nums[j])
    return len(ans)
```
