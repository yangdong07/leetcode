### 682. Baseball Game

**Stack**    [💚](https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game)    	[💡](https://leetcode.com/articles/baseball-game)

#### Description

You're now a baseball game point recorder.

Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:

`Integer` (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
`"+"` (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two `valid` round's points.
`"D"` (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last `valid` round's points.
`"C"` (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last `valid` round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.

Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.

You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.
```

Note:

The size of the input list will be between 1 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the list will be between -30000 and 30000.

#### Analysis

很简单的题目，baseball计分规则：

1. 数字，就是分数
2. 'D'， 就是把前一轮的有效分数翻倍，作为本轮分数
3. '+'， 就是把前两轮有效分数相加，作为本轮分数
4. 'C'， 是一个操作，把前一轮分数定为无效。

给出一列计分，求最后的分数总和。

例如 :

`["5","2","C","D","+"]` ，最后得分是 30分。

用栈就可以解决。 算法时间复杂度 $O(n)$， 空间复杂度 $O(n)$。

#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, ops):
        """
        :type ops: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        points = []
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'C':
                points.pop()
            elif op == 'D':
                points.append(points[-1] * 2)
            elif op == '+':
                points.append(points[-1] + points[-2])
            else:
                points.append(int(op))
        return sum(points)


Solution().calPoints(["5","2","C","D","+"])
```
