### 63. Unique Paths II

**Dynamic Programming**, **Array**    [🧡](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii)    

#### Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

#### Analysis

这题比之前 62题，多了一个障碍物。遇到障碍物，在障碍物处将路径数量清零即可。

```python
def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])

    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    for j in range(n):
        if obstacleGrid[0][j]:
            break
        dp[0][j] = 1

    for i in range(m):
        if obstacleGrid[i][0]:
            break
        dp[i][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][j]:
                dp[i][j] = 0
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
    return dp[-1][-1]
```
