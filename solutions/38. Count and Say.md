### 38. Count and Say

**String**    [💚](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say)    

#### Description

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n, generate the n^th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

#### Analysis

题意不清遭人恨啊。

这题的意思很简单， 第 `(i+1)` 的序列，是 第 `i`的序列的 count and say

1. `1` 就是 `1`
2. 上面是 1个1， 那么记为为 `11`
3. 上面是 2个1， 那么记为 `21`
4. 上面是 1个2， 1个1， 那么记为 `1211`
5. 上面是 1个1，1个2，2个1， 那么记为 `111221`

直白的按照题意写程序就可以了。

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        s = '1'
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            pd, tmp, count = s[0], "", 0
            for d in s:
                if d == pd:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    tmp += str(count) + pd
                    pd = d
                    count = 1
            tmp += str(count) + pd
            s = tmp
        return s
```
