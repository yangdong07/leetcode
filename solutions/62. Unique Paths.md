### 62. Unique Paths

**Dynamic Programming**, **Array**    [🧡](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths)    

#### Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

#### Analysis

典型的 DP 问题，甚至可以跳过 Backtracking 的思路，直接求解。

```
dp(i, j)    dp(i, j+1)
dp(i+1, j)  dp(i+1, j+1)
```

其中 `dp(i,j)` 是 到 `(i, j)` 位置的路径数量。

`dp(i + 1, j + 1) = dp(i, j + 1) + dp(i + 1, j)`

甚至可以简化只用一行。

```python
def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
    solutions = [1] * m
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m):
            solutions[j] += solutions[j - 1]

    return solutions[-1]
```
